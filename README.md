Bike Rental Demand Prediction Model
Overview:
This repository contains a predictive model for bike rental demand, employing both linear regression and random forest regression. The model aims to forecast the number of bike rentals based on various factors, including hours of the day, season, rainfall, and time of day.

Key Features:
Date--- date

Hour ---Hour of the day(0-23)

Temperature ---temperature of the day

Humidity ---Humidity measure

Windspeed --windspeed

Visibility---visibility measure

Dew point temperature ---Dew point temperature measure

Solar radiation---Solar radiation measure

rainfall --- Rainfall in mm

snowfall ---snowfall measures

Holiday---wether holiday or not

Seasons --- seasons

Functional day--- whether functional day or not
Model Architecture:
The predictive model employs two regression techniques:

Linear Regression: Utilizes a linear relationship between input features and bike rental demand.
Random Forest Regression: Leverages an ensemble of decision trees to capture non-linear relationships and improve predictive accuracy.
Dataset:
The model is trained and tested on a dataset that includes relevant features such as hours of the day, season, rainfall, and time of day. These features play a crucial role in understanding and predicting bike rental demand.

Preprocessing Steps:
The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables. This ensures the data is suitable for training both the linear regression and random forest regression models.

Training Process:
Linear Regression: Trained using a gradient descent optimization algorithm, minimizing the Mean Squared Error loss function.
Random Forest Regression: Trained using an ensemble of decision trees, allowing the model to capture complex relationships in the data.
Performance Metrics:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy of predictions.

Results:
The model demonstrates its predictive capabilities by providing insights into the factors influencing bike rental demand. Results include performance metrics on both the training and testing datasets, showcasing the models' effectiveness.

Usage:
Detailed instructions on using the model, including dependencies and example code, are provided in the repository. Users can easily integrate the model into their applications for demand forecasting.

Future Improvements:
Potential future enhancements may include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring additional regression techniques to further improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
